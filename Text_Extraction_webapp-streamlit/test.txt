more thermal resistance. Air space is an insulation layer and it does not permit the heat
1o flow from inside to outside. By providing double door windows. heat transfer may be
reduced.

2.5 THERMODYNAMICS

Thermodynamics is a branch of science that deals with heat transfer, conversion of
heat encrgy into mechanical or other forms of energy. Conversion of other forms of energy
into heat also comes under the preview of thermodynamics. The scientists Carnot, Mayor.
Clausius, Joule, Kelvin, Maxwell, Planck, and Gibbs developed the main parts of thermo-
dynamics. The study of thermodynamics is very important in the field of internal combus-
tion engines, air conditioning and refrigeration machineries.

2.5.1 THERMODYNAMIC SYSTEMS

A thermodynamic system is defined as a quantity of matter at a certain temperature
with certain thermal properties (working substance). The system is separated from the
surroundings by a system boundary. The state of system can be changed by changing the
thermodynamical coordinates.

If the boundary of system permits heat and work energies to cross the boundary but it
is impervious to the flow of matter, then the system is called a closed system.

If the boundary of the system permits not only energies like work and heat but also
matter across the boundary of the system, it is said to be an open system.

But in an isolated system, any form of energy or matter cannot cross the boundary of
the system. Thus this system is independent of the environmental changes.

It should be noted that in a thermally insulated system from its surroundings. it
becomes an adiabatic system. It can exchange work with the surrounding. This system
may be either open or closed.

2.5.2 THERMODYNAMIC COORDINATES

A thermodynamic system can be described in terms of quantities such as pressure,
volume, temperature and entropy. These quantities are known as thermodynamic coordi-
nates. The thermodynamical state of a system can be defined with the help of thermody-

namical coordinates.
